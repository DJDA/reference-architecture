# CSS

## Why

Though every Telus web property uses CSS, developers rarely write CSS directly. CSS is often either included as part of [TDS components](http://tds.telus.com/), transpiled from SCSS, or embedded in [JS](./javascript.md) components.

## What

Every front end site uses CSS in some shape or form at Telus.

## How

CSS can be written and maintained in many different ways. Developers at Telus are discouraged from writing CSS directly, and to instead go with the following options in order of preference:

1. Consume [React](./react.md) components from [TDS](http://tds.telus.com/)
1. Write [custom React components](./react.md#how)
1. Use SCSS
