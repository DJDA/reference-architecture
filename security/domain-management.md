# Domain Management

External TELUS digital properties and microsites must follow our standard subdomain substructure in order to ensure a consistent customer experience and maintain customer trust that they are on a TELUS websites. We do not support the use of unique domains (ie. telusrocks.com) and no domains should ever be registered by third party and digital partner groups.

When requesting a TELUS subdomain, keep in mind the following:
- Subdomains must have the following format: x.telus.com, ie community.telus.com
- The subdomain should represent the product or campaign name as clearly as possible
- The product/campaign name as part of the subdomain should be no more than 12 characters long
- Abbreviations and hyphens should be avoided
- The use of the brand name in the first part of the subdomain is not permitted (ie. teluscampaign.telus.com).
- Note: All product names must be approved through proper Brand/Marketing channels before a subdomain is set up
- The same structure requirements apply for other TELUS-owned brands (ie. koodo.com, publicmobile.ca, telushealth.com, telusinternational.com, etc)
- Some exception cases:
  - Telus.net - should be capped and limited to existing services already using it, such as email, TV and HSIA 
  - Telusmobility.com - should be capped and limited to existing services already using it. Storefronts have already migrated off of this and over to telus.com     	
  - Mobility.ca - domain to be used when brand agnostic domain is needed, such as on MMS client that can be installed on TELUS or Koodo devices.
