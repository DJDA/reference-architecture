##What
All security related concerns can be distilled into ensuring one or more of the
core Security Pillars. These Pillars are known as the CIA triad.
The Triad is formed by:
    1.  Confidentiality - This property means protecting the sensitive
        information from unauthorized access.

    2.  Integrity - This property centres around ensuring the data is not
        modified (tampered with) or deleted by unauthorised parties. It also
        needs to ensure that if data is tampered with it is detectable (tamper
        evident).

    3.  Availability - This property is concerned with the availabilty of the
        data, systems need to be designed to ensure the availabilty of the
        data.
##Why
Our customers are expecting us to uphold the CIA triad with regard to their
data. A compromised of any of the pillars within the triad could have material
impact to the trust customers have placed in our care.
##How
The CIA Triad can be ensured through vigiliant application of Information and
Application Security Controls.

##Who
It's Everyone's responsibility to uphold the CIA triad.
