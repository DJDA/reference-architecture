##Why
OWASP's Application Security Verification Standard [OWASP
ASVS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Projecti OWASP ASVS) is a prescriptive controls matrix which offers a certification level based on incrementally more strict control objectives. Agreeing to a certification can enable your team to have a rallying point over what controls are necessary within your project. These controls can be used to craft testable user stories and test criteria developed to authored as part of a TDD practice. The levels (1-3) increase in breadth and depth from 1 - Opportunistic, 2 - Standard and 3 Advanced. Level 0 is able to be customised, and is being explored by TELUS Digital Security team. Having a standardised methodology for evaluating the security posture of projects will enable a more consistent security practice, regardless of who is involved. Additionally, having a standard will enable a common currency for the interchange of ideas and design patterns.

##What
Agreeing to an ASVS Security Level  objective at the inception of your project can
ensure all the security concerns are flushed out over the course of your
project. User stories and Evil User stories, based off the control bjectives (and violation of control objectives) can ensure the requisite
security concern space is entirely serviced, and no gaps exist. Formalizing
this discussion enables a common understanding that can be socialized with the
team as a common objective.
Wherever possible these stories should have a testable element with acceptance
criteria.
##How
With your team, identify the control objective your project is intent on
achieving  (1-3). Thereafter use this level and it's prescribed controls to
craft user stories and evil user stories ensuring the prescribed controls are
serviced and testable. 
##Who
Product Owners should consult with their assigned security team resource to
identify an appropriate level to aspire to. Therafter, a Product Owner should
consult with their team socializing the level expected and work to craft user
stories and evil user stories as necessary to satisfy the respective control
objectives.
