# Security

## Why

It's important to us that a TELUS customer’s journey is protected so that we can further build on our brand's trust and reliability. We are committed to respecting our customers’ privacy and safeguarding their information. In a time where the threat to our industry continues to increase in various forms of fraudulent behaviour and cybercrime, the emphasis on a customer's privacy and security also increases.
 
## What

TELUS Security Standards are intended to serve as guidelines to which we should adhere during the project development lifecycle. The goal is to mitigate business risks and provide customer solutions that take every opportunity to protect:
 
- Customer information that is entrusted to us
- The TELUS brand and customer trust

## How

The following are the security guidelines:

- [Guiding Principles](guiding-principles.md)
- [Project Inception and Security Process](project-inception-and-security-process.md)
- [Data Security and Encryption](data-security-and-encryption.md)
- [PI security](PI-security.md)
- [Web Configuration](web-configuration.md)
- [Domain Management](domain-management.md)
- [Password Management](password-management.md)
- [Application Security Testing](app-sec-testing.md)
- [Secure Coding Practices](secure-coding-practices.md)
- [Contact](contact.md)

Owners or stakeholders of TELUS projects should use the security guidelines as follows:
- review at project inception
- use as reference or checklist during SDLC
- keep the security guidelines in mind during development
- adhere to the guidelines throughout the project
- ensure the standards are met prior to launch
- if any deviations of the standards are required contact security team for consultation ( see [Contact](contact.md) )
